Hi! I'm Fatimah Alghamdi! 

I am currently a third-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in Machine Learning.
I’ve always been fascinated by technology and coding, and I’m eager to explore how Machine Learning can be used to solve real-world challenges.
In my free time, I enjoy online shopping and journaling.

Looking forward to learning more about Machine Learning!
