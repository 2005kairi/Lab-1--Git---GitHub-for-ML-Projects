The diabetes dataset contains medical information about female patients of Pima Indian heritage who are at least 21 years old. Each row represents one patient and includes several diagnostic measurements such as number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, 
insulin level, BMI,diabetes pedigree function, and age. These measurements act as the predictor variables. The target variable, Outcome, indicates whether the patient has diabetes (1) or does not have diabetes (0).This is a binary classification problem, because the task is to classify
each patient into one of two categories: diabetic or non diabetic. The model is expected to learn patterns from the medical features and identify which combinations of measurements are associated with a higher likelihood of diabetes. Once trained, the model should be able to take a new
patient’s diagnostic values and predict whether that patient is likely to have diabetes.For this Lab, the dataset was obtained from Kagglein CSV format, imported and explored using Jupyter Notebook, and the workflow was illustrated using a methodology diagram created in draw.io.
